# YSU_rPi_cam
YSU Raspberry Pi + openFrameworks DIY camera workshop

##Overview
This is a DIY digital camera designed to introduce workshop attendees the [Raspberry Pi computer][1], [openFrameworks C++ toolkit][2] and basic image processing. This repo includes an openFrameworks application that pulls in video from a webcam, processes that video into either an overlaid still image or a GIF. The application saves files to a different partition on the Pi's SD card. That way, users can turn off the pi, remove the SD card, plug the SD card into their computer and access the images, similar to a traditional digital camera.
